# QUOTES

1-> To run this application MySql database should be installed.

2-> Modify properties file by adding local user and psw to be connected with database.

3-> Update path for log4j (referring to local dir)

        #App will start on port 8080.

* Use link below to open swagger documentation: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

* External service to retrieve list of quotes is triggered on start of project as a @postconstruct, values are inserted on table.


ps: Mainly I have relied on building apis, and so I haven't put test (mockito).
